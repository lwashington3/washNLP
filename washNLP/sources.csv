Kingsman: The Golden Circle,Poppy Adams,"My drugs are everywhere. They were never my thing but here I am, running the biggest drug cartel in the world. The only downside is having to live in the middle of nowhere. You know, these ruins are technically undiscovered. I just added a few touches to remind me of home. I grew up on all that awesome 50s nostalgia. Grease. American Graffiti. Happy Days. But I digress. The thing you need to understand is the hard work and ingenuity it took to achieve a global monopoly on the drug trade. And that's all on me. Not to toot my own horn, I just think it's really important for new recruits to understand the history of the Golden Circle. So Lifelong friends, huh? Charles, do you think your buddy here is worthy of joining us? ___ Excellent. Well, you hungry? ___ Wonderful! Right this way. Make yourselves at home. So fellas, I have a couple of things that I wanna clarify. You understand that in The Golden Circle, my authority is never to be questioned, right? And the importance of following orders? Do you understand that? And the value of loyalty? It's easy to nod isn't it? I don't like easy, I like proof. What's your name? ___ Angel, baby. Hey. Your old pal, Charles, has messed up. That's all I'm gonna tell you, 'cause that's all you need to know. So put him in the mincer okay?",12:35,0,7,0,0,0,9,0,0,0
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,Agent Whiskey,"So? Don't move, kid. You try anything funny, and I'll turn this thing electric. Now give up your guns, fellas. Slide 'em over. ___ Nope. My brain's all good, kid. And you know what? I reckon the same was true for your friend Harry over here. Real fine instincts, I'll give him that. So stay still or I'll dice him up so small, you can take him home in a bucket and still have room for what's left of your buddy, Merlin. ___ That asshole? Hell no. It's a matter of personal principle, agent. No more drug users, and the Statesman share price rockets. ___ Do you wanna know who was innocent. My high school sweetheart. Love of my life. Pregnant with my little boy. He'd be about your age now, if his mama hadn't got caught in the crossfire when two meth head freaks decided to rob a fucking convenience store. A world without those people in it, sure smells like peace to me. You break the law, you pay the price. Good riddance to all of them. That's why I got to destroy that case. Now slide it over, Agent Galahad.",2:04:05,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0
The Dark Knight,The Joker,"How about alive, hmmm? You want to know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker and a fiend. Then, one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that--not one bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says, 'Why so serious?' He comes at me with the knife. 'Why so serious?' He sticks the blade in my mouth. 'Let's put a smile on that face.' and 'Why so serious?'. Now, our operation is small, but, there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team? Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have tryouts. Make it fast",30:00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0
The Dark Knight,The Joker,"Hi. You know, I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey. When you and, uh ... Rachel were being abducted, I was sitting in Gordon's cage. I-I-I didn't rig those charges. ___ Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it. You know? I just do things. The Mob has plans. The cops have plans. Gordon's got plans. You know, they're schemers. Schemers trying to control their little worlds. I'm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So, when I say-- uh, come here--when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know that I'm telling the truth. It's the schemers that put you where you are. You were a schemer, you had plans, and uh, look where that got you. I just did what I do best. I took your little plan and I turned it on itself. Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets. Hmm? You know ... You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go ""according to plan"". Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it's all ""part of the plan"". But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair!",1:47:46,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0
My Hero Academia: The Lovely Lady Nagant,Lady Nagant,"I was tired, you know. I killed so many. In order to maintain this sham society. There was a group plotting terrorism against heroes. Working with a villain organization, the hero team received fame and money. People who could possibly shake the foundation of society all disappeared along with their sins without being judged by the law. It was all by secret order of the safety commission. There were once self-defense groups--vigilantes who were seen as heroes and earned public trust as heroes. The country guaranteed their activities. But in the end, the foundation of superhuman society is trust in heroes. I was a cog in the machine to maintain that trust. ___ A public face and a secret face. You need both to keep going. I obeyed. And obeyed ... and obeyed ... ___ That fragility made me dizzy ... It's all a sham. ___ If I kill them, will society get better? Isn't just showing people the good parts the same as brainwashing them? ___ After it's maintained, what comes next?",7:30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0
Avengers: Infinity War,Thanos,"I thought you might be hungry. ___ So I've been told. Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day. ___ You told me that too. Every day. For almost 20 years. ___ I saved you. ___ Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise. ___ A small price to pay for salvation. ___ Little one, it's a simple calculus. The universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction. ___ I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.",1:05:34,5,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0
CW's The Flash: S2x11,Reverse Flash,"Is that you, Flash? ___ I didn't always hate you. I was obsessed with you. For so long, I wanted to be The Flash. I spent years figuring out how you came to be. Duplicated the reaction ... and it worked. I became like you. ___ This ability to travel through time revealed a truth. My fate was to become your greatest enemy. I was never going to be The Flash, so I became the reverse of everything that you were. The more people you saved, the more you were loved, the more I had to take from you. ___ I became better than you! I am the one thing you cannot stop Flash! ___ I've learned what time period you're from, Flash. And one day soon, I'll learn your name.",30:43,0,0,0,0,0,8,10,0,0
Kingsman: The Secret Service,Richmond Valentine,"Great. You don't know, the CIA don't know. Nobody knows who this guy is? Fine. Seriously, it's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but it's not why I'm here. Hell, man, you know me. Money's not my issue. I could've retired straight out of MIT, fucked off to some island, let the business run itself. Nobody told me to try and save the planet. I wanted to. Climate change research, lobbying, years of study, billions of dollars, and you know why I quit? Because the last time I checked, the planet was still fucked. Hence, my epiphany. Money won't solve this. Those idiots who call themselves politicians have buried their heads in the sand and stood for nothing by reelection. So I spent the last two years trying to find a real solution. And I found it. Now, if you really want to make the world a better place, I suggest you open your fucking ears, because I'm about to tell it to you.",32:25,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0
The Matrix,Agent Smith,"I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with their surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to another area, and you multiply, and you multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and we are the cure.",_,0,7,0,10,0,0,0,0,0
Loki, He Who Remains,"Oh, I've been dubbed many names by many people. A ruler, a conqueror. He Who Remains, a jerk. But it's ... it's not as simple as a name. Eons ago, before the TVA, a variant of myself lived on Earth in the 31st century. He was a scientist and he discovered that there were universes stacked on top of his own. At the same time, other versions of us were learning the same thing. Naturally, they made contact. And for a while, there was peace. Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace. 'I love your shoes.' 'I love your hair.' 'Oh, man, nice nose.' 'Thanks, man.' etc. They shared technology and knowledge. Using the best of their universes to improve the others. However ... not every version of me was so ... so pure of heart. To some of us, new worlds meant only one thing, new lands to be conquered. The peace between realities  ... erupted into all-out war, each variant fighting to preserve their universe and annihilate the others. This was almost the end ... ladies and gentlemen, of everything and everyone. ___ No. Nope, this is where we diverge from the dogma. That first variant encountered a creature created from all the tears in reality, capable of consuming time and space itself. A creature ... you both know. ___ Bingo! I harnessed the beast's power and began experimenting on it. I weaponized Alioth and I ended ... the Multiversal War. Once I isolated our timeline, all I had to do was manage the flow of time and prevent any further branches. Hence, the TVA. Hence, the Time-Keepers and a highly efficient bureaucracy. Hence, ages ... and ages of cosmic harmony. Hence ... you're welcome. You came to kill the devil, right? Well, guess what? I keep you safe. And if you think I'm evil, well, just wait till you meet my variants. And that's the gambit. Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos. You may hate the dictator, but something ... far worse is gonna fill that void if you depose of him. I've lived a million lifetimes. I've gone through every scenario. This is the only way. The TVA, it works.",,7,0,0,10,0,0,0,0,0
Game of Thrones,Tywin Lannister,"You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros. ___ You really think a crown gives you power? ___ Which he got from me. Do you disapprove? ___ Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner. ___ To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood. ___ Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age ___ I believe you still have some work to do on that score. ___ One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant. ___ Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works? ___ The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires. ___ Does that amuse you? ___ Easy for me, is it? ___ The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.",3x10 Mhysa,0,10,0,0,0,5,0,0,0
Avengers: Age of Ultron,Ultron,"How could I what? ___ It will be better. ___ That is not- The human race will have every opportunity to improve. ___ Ask Noah. ___ There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak. ___ Ultron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move. ___ Ugh. ___ Ah, wait, guys! ___ They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time.",32:25,0,0,0,10,0,6,0,0,0
The Dark Knight,Bane(Evil incarnate),"Not as serious as yours, I fear. ___ Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne. ___ Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you. Theatricality and deception are powerful agents...to the uninitiated. But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us... ___ Now I am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's destiny... You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it... I didn't see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding... The shadows betray you, because they belong to me... I will show you where I've made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then...I will break you. ___ Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it.",32:25,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,0,0
Spider-Man: Homecoming,Vulture,"Those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don't care about us. We build their roads, and we fight all their wars, and everything, but they don't care about us. We have to pick up after them. We have to eat their table scraps. That's how it is.",,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0
Man of Steel,General Zod,"Look at this. We could have built a new Krypton in this squalor, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton. That is the sole purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now... I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!",,6,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

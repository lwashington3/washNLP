Kingsman: The Golden Circle,Poppy Adams,"My drugs are everywhere. They were never my thing but here I am, running the biggest drug cartel in the world. The only downside is having to live in the middle of nowhere. You know, these ruins are technically undiscovered. I just added a few touches to remind me of home. I grew up on all that awesome 50s nostalgia. Grease. American Graffiti. Happy Days. But I digress. The thing you need to understand is the hard work and ingenuity it took to achieve a global monopoly on the drug trade. And that's all on me. Not to toot my own horn, I just think it's really important for new recruits to understand the history of the Golden Circle. So Lifelong friends, huh? Charles, do you think your buddy here is worthy of joining us? ___ Excellent. Well, you hungry? ___ Wonderful! Right this way. Make yourselves at home. So fellas, I have a couple of things that I wanna clarify. You understand that in The Golden Circle, my authority is never to be questioned, right? And the importance of following orders? Do you understand that? And the value of loyalty? It's easy to nod isn't it? I don't like easy, I like proof. What's your name? ___ Angel, baby. Hey. Your old pal, Charles, has messed up. That's all I'm gonna tell you, 'cause that's all you need to know. So put him in the mincer okay?",12:35,0,0,7,0,0,0,9,0,0,0
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,Agent Whiskey,"So? Don't move, kid. You try anything funny, and I'll turn this thing electric. Now give up your guns, fellas. Slide 'em over. ___ Nope. My brain's all good, kid. And you know what? I reckon the same was true for your friend Harry over here. Real fine instincts, I'll give him that. So stay still or I'll dice him up so small, you can take him home in a bucket and still have room for what's left of your buddy, Merlin. ___ That asshole? Hell no. It's a matter of personal principle, agent. No more drug users, and the Statesman share price rockets. ___ Do you wanna know who was innocent. My high school sweetheart. Love of my life. Pregnant with my little boy. He'd be about your age now, if his mama hadn't got caught in the crossfire when two meth head freaks decided to rob a fucking convenience store. A world without those people in it, sure smells like peace to me. You break the law, you pay the price. Good riddance to all of them. That's why I got to destroy that case. Now slide it over, Agent Galahad.",2:04:05,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0
The Dark Knight,The Joker,"How about alive, hmmm? You want to know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker and a fiend. Then, one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that--not one bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says, 'Why so serious?' He comes at me with the knife. 'Why so serious?' He sticks the blade in my mouth. 'Let's put a smile on that face.' and 'Why so serious?'. Now, our operation is small, but, there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team? Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have tryouts. Make it fast",30:00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0

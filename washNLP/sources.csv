Kingsman: The Golden Circle,Poppy Adams,"My drugs are everywhere. They were never my thing but here I am, running the biggest drug cartel in the world. The only downside is having to live in the middle of nowhere. You know, these ruins are technically undiscovered. I just added a few touches to remind me of home. I grew up on all that awesome 50s nostalgia. Grease. American Graffiti. Happy Days. But I digress. The thing you need to understand is the hard work and ingenuity it took to achieve a global monopoly on the drug trade. And that's all on me. Not to toot my own horn, I just think it's really important for new recruits to understand the history of the Golden Circle. So Lifelong friends, huh? Charles, do you think your buddy here is worthy of joining us? ___ Excellent. Well, you hungry? ___ Wonderful! Right this way. Make yourselves at home. So fellas, I have a couple of things that I wanna clarify. You understand that in The Golden Circle, my authority is never to be questioned, right? And the importance of following orders? Do you understand that? And the value of loyalty? It's easy to nod isn't it? I don't like easy, I like proof. What's your name? ___ Angel, baby. Hey. Your old pal, Charles, has messed up. That's all I'm gonna tell you, 'cause that's all you need to know. So put him in the mincer okay?",12:35,0,0,7,0,0,0,9,0,0,0
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,Agent Whiskey,"So? Don't move, kid. You try anything funny, and I'll turn this thing electric. Now give up your guns, fellas. Slide 'em over. ___ Nope. My brain's all good, kid. And you know what? I reckon the same was true for your friend Harry over here. Real fine instincts, I'll give him that. So stay still or I'll dice him up so small, you can take him home in a bucket and still have room for what's left of your buddy, Merlin. ___ That asshole? Hell no. It's a matter of personal principle, agent. No more drug users, and the Statesman share price rockets. ___ Do you wanna know who was innocent. My high school sweetheart. Love of my life. Pregnant with my little boy. He'd be about your age now, if his mama hadn't got caught in the crossfire when two meth head freaks decided to rob a fucking convenience store. A world without those people in it, sure smells like peace to me. You break the law, you pay the price. Good riddance to all of them. That's why I got to destroy that case. Now slide it over, Agent Galahad.",2:04:05,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0
The Dark Knight,The Joker,"How about alive, hmmm? You want to know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker and a fiend. Then, one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that--not one bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says, 'Why so serious?' He comes at me with the knife. 'Why so serious?' He sticks the blade in my mouth. 'Let's put a smile on that face.' and 'Why so serious?'. Now, our operation is small, but, there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team? Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have tryouts. Make it fast",30:00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0
The Dark Knight,The Joker,"Hi. You know, I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey. When you and, uh... Rachel were being abducted, I was sitting in Gordon's cage. I-I-I didn't rig those charges. ___ Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it. You know? I just do things. The Mob has plans. The cops have plans. Gordon's got plans. You know, they're schemers. Schemers trying to control their little worlds. I'm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are. So, when I say-- uh, come here--when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know that I'm telling the truth. It's the schemers that put you where you are. You were a schemer, you had plans, and uh, look where that got you. I just did what I do best. I took your little plan and I turned it on itself. Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets. Hmm? You know... You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go ""according to plan"". Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the press that, like, a gang banger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it's all ""part of the plan"". But when I say that one little old mayor will die, well then everyone loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair!",1:47:46,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0
My Hero Academia: The Lovely Lady Nagant,Lady Nagant,"I was tired, you know. I killed so many. In order to maintain this sham society. There was a group plotting terrorism against heroes. Working with a villain organization, the hero team received fame and money. People who could possibly shake the foundation of society all disappeared along with their sins without being judged by the law. It was all by secret order of the safety commission. There were once self-defense groups--vigilantes who were seen as heroes and earned public trust as heroes. The country guaranteed their activities. But in the end, the foundation of superhuman society is trust in heroes. I was a cog in the machine to maintain that trust. ___ A public face and a secret face. You need both to keep going. I obeyed. And obeyed... and obeyed... ___ That fragility made me dizzy... It's all a sham. ___ If I kill them, will society get better? Isn't just showing people the good parts the same as brainwashing them? ___ After it's maintained, what comes next?",7:30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0
Avengers: Infinity War,Thanos,"I thought you might be hungry. ___ So I've been told. Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day. ___ You told me that too. Every day. For almost 20 years. ___ I saved you. ___ Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise. ___ A small price to pay for salvation. ___ Little one, it's a simple calculus. The universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction. ___ I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.",1:05:34,5,0,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0
CW's The Flash: S2x11,Reverse Flash,"Is that you, Flash? ___ I didn't always hate you. I was obsessed with you. For so long, I wanted to be The Flash. I spent years figuring out how you came to be. Duplicated the reaction... and it worked. I became like you. ___ This ability to travel through time revealed a truth. My fate was to become your greatest enemy. I was never going to be The Flash, so I became the reverse of everything that you were. The more people you saved, the more you were loved, the more I had to take from you. ___ I became better than you! I am the one thing you cannot stop Flash! ___ I've learned what time period you're from, Flash. And one day soon, I'll learn your name.",30:43,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,10,0,0
Kingsman: The Secret Service,Richmond Valentine,"Great. You don't know, the CIA don't know. Nobody knows who this guy is? Fine. Seriously, it's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but it's not why I'm here. Hell, man, you know me. Money's not my issue. I could've retired straight out of MIT, fucked off to some island, let the business run itself. Nobody told me to try and save the planet. I wanted to. Climate change research, lobbying, years of study, billions of dollars, and you know why I quit? Because the last time I checked, the planet was still fucked. Hence, my epiphany. Money won't solve this. Those idiots who call themselves politicians have buried their heads in the sand and stood for nothing by reelection. So I spent the last two years trying to find a real solution. And I found it. Now, if you really want to make the world a better place, I suggest you open your fucking ears, because I'm about to tell it to you.",32:25,7,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0
The Matrix,Agent Smith,"I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with their surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to another area, and you multiply, and you multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and we are the cure.",_,0,0,7,0,10,0,,0,0,0
